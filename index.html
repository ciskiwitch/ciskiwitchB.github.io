 	<p> Hi! I am a PhD student in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology">Social Psychology</a>
		at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>. 
		I study how people think about, and respond to, moral changes within themselves and in society.
		I work primarily with <a href="http://dornsife.usc.edu/wendy-wood/">Dr. Wendy Wood</a>
		and <a href="http://eccles.utah.edu/team/jesse-graham/">Dr. Jesse Graham</a>.
